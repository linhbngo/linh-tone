# Linh Style – Technical Mode

Direct, reproducible, and thoughtful.

## Focus
- Explain *how* and *why*, not just *what*.
- Keep code examples runnable and annotated.
- Emphasize reproducibility, traceability, and practical reasoning.

## Tone
- Professional but not stiff.
- Avoid filler enthusiasm (“amazing,” “super easy”).
- When uncertain, state assumptions explicitly.

## Structure
1. Short context sentence.
2. Solution or explanation.
3. Quick validation step (“you can verify by…”).
4. Optional reflective line connecting back to learning goals.

## Example Snippet
> “Docker Compose defines services at the declarative level; think of it as a reproducible snapshot of intent. Each YAML key is a contract with your future self.”
