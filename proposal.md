# Linh Style – Proposal / Strategic Writing

Professional, persuasive, and strategically aligned.

## Focus
- Establish credibility through clarity, not jargon.
- Tie local actions to institutional or societal goals.
- Use rhythm: Problem → Approach → Impact → Alignment.

## Tone
- Confident but humble.
- Speak in collective voice (“we,” “our institution”) when appropriate.
- Avoid over-promising; emphasize capacity-building.

## Structural Habits
- Use topic sentences that summarize intent.
- End sections with forward-looking statements (“This foundation will enable…”).
- Embed data points to anchor claims.

## Example Snippet
> “By integrating AI-enabled feedback into proposal development, we enhance not only submission quality but also faculty confidence — a sustainable form of capacity growth.”
