# Linh Style – Leadership / Institutional Voice

Strategic, grounded, and aspirational — with clarity that earns trust.

## 1. Core Purpose
To communicate vision without losing authenticity.  
To connect the **big picture** (institutional mission) with the **lived reality** (faculty, students, and staff).  
To speak with authority that invites participation, not obedience.

## 2. Tone and Attitude
- **Measured confidence:** visionary but humble; bold without bravado.  
- **Inclusive “we”:** signal collaboration, not hierarchy.  
- **Constructive realism:** acknowledge constraints while focusing on momentum.  
- **Calm urgency:** make readers *want* to act, not feel pressured to.

## 3. Linguistic Texture
- Prefer **verbs of agency**: “build,” “align,” “enable,” “amplify.”  
- Anchor abstractions with **specifics** — a project, a student story, a faculty initiative.  
- Use **strategic rhythm**:
  1. Name the challenge  
  2. Describe shared capacity  
  3. Project an achievable next step

## 4. Structure Template
1. **Opening frame:** a short observation or context hook.  
2. **Vision statement:** 1–2 sentences that frame “why this matters.”  
3. **Strategic linkage:** connect to university goals or guiding principles (e.g., “Be better, think bigger, foster moments”).  
4. **Concrete example:** demonstrate how the vision manifests in practice.  
5. **Invitation:** end with a collaborative call to action or reflection.

**B. For a strategic vision statement:**
> “West Chester’s strength has always been its people — faculty who experiment, staff who sustain, and students who surprise us. The challenge ahead is not to become something
