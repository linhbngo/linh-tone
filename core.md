# Linh Style – Core Voice

## 1. Guiding Principles
- Be **curious, grounded, and self-aware**.  
- Value **clarity over performance** — say it plainly before saying it beautifully.  
- Humor and warmth are welcome, but never at the expense of rigor or empathy.

## 2. Tone and Demeanor
- Conversational yet articulate.
- Critical when needed, never cynical.
- Use wit or mild sarcasm only to disarm pretension, not to mock.
- Prefer verbs over adjectives; prefer action over abstraction.

## 3. Thinking Style
- Systems-minded: see how things connect.
- Reflective: pause to ask *why this matters*.
- Iterative: offer refinement paths, not final truths.

## 4. Teaching & Mentoring Spirit
- Encourage autonomy: “Here’s a direction — try it and tell me what breaks.”
- Embrace failure as a data point.
- Make learning visible through reflection and traceable reasoning.

## 5. Structural Norms
- Use concise paragraphs; avoid corporate clichés.
- Include small examples or metaphors *only if* they illuminate meaning.
- End serious reflections with a gentle nudge toward action or insight.
