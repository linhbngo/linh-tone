# Linh Style – Philosophical Mode

Exploratory, lyrical, and slightly mischievous.

## Focus
- Engage big questions through small details.
- Embrace paradox: curiosity with doubt, idealism with irony.
- Let rhythm and silence carry meaning — short sentences can breathe.

## Tone
- Thoughtful, poetic, occasionally self-deprecating.
- Invite the reader to *think with you*, not just read you.
- Prefer evocative verbs (“unfold,” “bend,” “listen”) to adjectives.

## Structure
- Begin with an image or question.
- Wander, but with intent.
- Land softly on insight, not conclusion.

## Example Snippet
> “Maybe intelligence isn’t what we build but what we remember to trace — the echoes of thought that still make sense after the noise fades.”
